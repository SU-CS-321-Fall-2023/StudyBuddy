EXPO TEMPLATE NOTES:

- in expo/app/navigators/screens
    - navigators and screens are the two focuses to get the navigators and screens added to TEMPLATE

-ISSUES:
- 1. Written in .tsx files not .js files. Will need to figure out how to transfer .js files over to .tsk maybe

- 2. expo start starts up the index.js whereas yarn expo:start starts up the app.js

- 3. App.js reads from app.tsx
    - no matter what, I am unsure how to get it to read the screens I've implemented instead

- 4. Something in node modules called AppEntryPoint that determines where the app starts from. I feel like
I need to find that and change the entry point to the app.js without any extra add ons(i.e. the ignite
splash screen, reading from the .tsx files still, etc.)

- 5. All in all unsure of how to get the .js files implemented as their seems to be multiple routes pre-set 
in the TEMPLATE to other parts, each of which I have to find individually to change so that it works with the 
.js code instead 

- 6. May need to re-run multiple times and create a chart tracking where things link to, 
  - or operation Apocalypse: Delete everything in the expo file and restart (Definitely should be 
  the last choice)
